Configuring your chart is made through the Configure chart menu, accessible from the top right.

![Chart config](./readme-assets/chart_view_config1.png)

*There are three main sections in the chart configuration panel: Data, Design and Settings.*

Picking the type of your chart is made in the series of icons at the top of the configuration panel.

## 1.1 Configure a bar chart

In the data section, pick the Series and the Groupings.
A bar chart can have one or two levels of grouping and does not have any limit in the number of series.

> It is strongly recommended to have only one series when two level of groupings are present.


### a. Bar chart with one level of grouping and multiple series

In a bar chart, the first level of grouping will always be the X-Axis. There will be one "bar" per group and per series.





### b. Bar chart with two levels of grouping and one series

In addition to proposing a Python SDK to interact with your data in Python, KAWA also comes in with its own Python runtimes.
These runtimes can be deployed in your infrastructure and scaled out to fit your use cases and load.

ðŸ“š You can find example workbooks and additional documentation here: [KAWA Tools Github Repository](https://github.com/kawa-analytics/kawa-toolkits).

**Kawa is a unified, collaborative analytics workspace** that takes you **from source to app** — connect data, model in sheets and formulas, explore with views and charts, automate actions, and publish dashboards and apps in one place with a shared source of truth, so teams ship faster.

***

## How Kawa works

**Build, run, and scale data apps — fast.**\
Kawa unifies your flow from raw data to published apps. Connect sources, model and compute, explore in views and charts, automate actions, and publish dashboards.

**What you can do**

* **Collect**: databases, APIs, files, unstructured data.
* **Model & compute**: sheets, joins, formulas, lookups, mappings.
* **Explore**: grids, charts, pivots, saved views.
* **Automate**: no-code triggers, conditions, multi-step actions.
* **Publish**: dashboards and end-to-end apps for your team.
* **Extend**: custom logic (Python), reusable libraries, chat & agents.

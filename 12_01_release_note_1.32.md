# Release note - KAWA 1.32

## 1. New Features

### 1.1 Cross Filters — on dashboards, filter multiple widgets at once with a single selection

- Set it up in the **Config panel**.

- Active filters show as chips at the top.

- Each widget has a filter status icon that lists active filters (cross + dashboard + control panel) and lets you turn them on/off for that widget.

Benefits: fewer duplicate filters, faster analysis, shared context across widgets.

### 1.2 Widget in full screen mode in application and dashboard

All type of widgets ( charts , pivot and grid) will have an new icon full screen in dashboard and application.

### 1.3 The query cache on external DataSources

Query cache configuration (per data source). Turn caching on/off, set TTL in seconds, and define an optional daily UTC window when cache is bypassed. Existing Clear query cache action remains available.
For complete documentation and setup details, please visit: [KAWA Query Cache](10_03_query_cache.md) section.

### 1.4 Python scripts: File upload parameters 

Add a file-upload field to a script by setting 'fileExtensions'. Users can upload only the allowed formats, and Apply stays disabled until all required files are uploaded.

### 1.5 Run Python tool for scripts without inputs/outputs

Triggers a script with no inputs/outputs (scriptType: "RUNNABLE"). Pick the script in the control settings (FE stores the scriptId; no Python private join/mapping needed). On click the script runs and the view auto-refreshes when it’s done.

Create an editable data source in two ways:

Start from scratch — same flow as before, with a richer creation modal for custom columns.

Quick upload — upload a CSV and start editing right away (uses the existing CSV upload component).

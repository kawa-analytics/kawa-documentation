## 1. New Features

### 1.1 Workflows — design, schedule, and run multi‑step automations

> You can read more about this in the [The Workflows section](07_00_workflows.md).

- Set it up in **Home** → **Workflows** (click **+ Workflow**).

![Release](./readme-assets/release(1.34)1.png)

- Trigger types (**WHEN**): Daily / Intraday / Weekly / Monthly / Manual only + Timezone and Only on business days.

![Release](./readme-assets/release(1.34)2.png)

- Actions (**THEN**): Transform data (Sheets), Run python script (from the library), Send email, AI prompt.

![Release](./readme-assets/release(1.34)3.png)

- **Bindings** link fields from the current step to outputs from previous steps, passing data between actions in a workflow.

![Release](./readme-assets/release(1.34)4.png)

- **Save & Update**: Click **Create workflow** to save a new workflow; after any edits, click **Update workflow**.

- **Run & monitor**: open **Run history** (top‑right) → Run for ad‑hoc execution; review Start / End / Status / Error with counters (Total / Success / Failed) and date filters.

**Workflows** make it easier than ever to turn your data into action—automate routine tasks, deliver consistent email/AI outputs, and stay safe with built‑in guardrails and run history.

### 1.2 Doc — a free-length document page that combines text and interactive widgets.

> You can read more about this in the [The Reports section](05_01_reports.md).

- Set it up in **Home** → **+ Report** → **Doc** (next to Dashboard and Slides).
- Quick **block** insert via + or /: Text, H1–H3, Bulleted/Numbered list, Checklist, Сode, Image, Add widget.

- **Block handle** (six dots) with context menu: Convert to, Move up/Move down, Delete.

![Release](./readme-assets/release(1.34)7.png)

- **Add widget** in a Doc: choose a Sheet → Existing or New widget (chart, grid, pivot).

![Release](./readme-assets/release(1.34)8.png)

- **Filters & exploration**: work the same as in dashboards (Control panel, Exploration mode).
- **Widget actions** (Refresh, Summary, Edit, Full screen, Rename, Disable/Enable all filters, Duplicate, Synchronize, Go to sheet, Delete) — identical to Dashboard.

**Doc** turns insights into stories—write your narrative, drop in live widgets, and share a single scrollable page that stays in sync with your data.

### 1.3 Synchronize widgets for all types of Reports

All types of Reports will have a new **Synchronize** option; it pulls the latest configuration and schema from the linked Sheet/View so the widget reflects recent changes while keeping its size and position.

### 1.4 Exploration mode for all types of Reports

All types of Reports have a new Exploration mode (via the Explore binoculars) to quickly adjust how a widget shows data and changes affect only this widget.

### 1.5 AI Chat — New section type: Code (streaming)

AI Chat now includes a new Code section that streams code in real time via Server-Sent Events with a pending loader, using the same UI as Analysis.

### 1.6 Create with AI in Reports 

A new Create with AI option in the + Report menus opens a prompt-based modal to generate a Dashboard/Slides/Docs, with multi-select Sheets and Knowledge, and returns the created object.

### 1.7 New sheet creation options in Sheets

The Create sheet menu is expanded: alongside the existing From Data Source option, there are now two new choices — From CSV, which uploads a CSV, initializes a new “from-scratch” dataset with that CSV, auto-creates a sheet, and redirects you to the sheet’s default grid; and From Scratch, which does the same creation and redirect but without a CSV upload.

### 1.8 Advanced pasting in Edit Sheet

Users editing sheets now have Advanced pasting: a single value fills the selection, N vertical values repeat across it, and any N×M block tiles to cover the range (Google Sheets–style).

### 1.9 Documentation page for Sheets & Data Sources

Introduced a new Documentation tab on Sheets and Data Sources that opens an auto-published report for documenting the dataset.

- Who can edit: only users with WRITE access to the sheet/data source.
- Auto-publish: edits are saved immediately.
- Creation flow: the page is created on first open, linked to the corresponding sheetId or dataSourceId.
- Visibility: these docs do not appear in Dashboards.
